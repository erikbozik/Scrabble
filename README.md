Game explanation:

A loading screen shows up after running the script. 
After that you are brought to the main menu with multiple game options which are shown in slovak.
One player mode brings you straight to the game while the option for multiple players asks
you further about the number of players desired to play.
Once brought into the game you see a board and game start button. 
After starting the game by pressing the start game button, mutliple infotainment shows.
Now you add tiles to the board to create words. Be careful to add 
only to the center line when in first round. Once added click the button to check the word.
If the word is correct, your only option is to end the game and give it to the next player.
When your tiles are not suitable to create any words, you can change them once it's your turn by pressing the button.
This also forces you to end your turn by pressing the button. Keep checking the text on the infotainment and buttons
to know exactly what to do.
Have fun!
